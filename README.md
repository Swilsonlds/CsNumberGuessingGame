# CsNumberGuessingGame
As the repo name suggests, this program is a basic number guessing game. The program will select a random number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the user will be told whether their guess is higher or lower than the random number, in addition to a list containing all previous guesses. Upon succesfully guessing the number, the user will be given the option to play the game again, or exit the program.

It's been a while since I've written any code in C#. I plan on creating some basic projects in the coming weeks and months to refamiliarize myself with the language.
